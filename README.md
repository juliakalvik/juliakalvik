HI FRIEND👋

🌱 I’m currently studying to become a Front End Developer at Noroff in Oslo, Norway. I have already been studying for one year, and have one left. 

🎓 I have a masters degree in religion, ethics and social studies from earlier, and used to be a teacher.    

📸 Besides studying, I am working full time as a freelance photographer, which I really love doing. I mostly do weddings, especially during summer, but I also so other things like fashion, portrait and family photos.

👩🏻‍💻 My passion for visuals combined with learning how to code is a really exciting journey for me!
I really enjoy design and creating prototypes as well as the programming.

⚡ Fun fact: my favorite TV show is The Office, and I have never worked a place without being part of the party planning committe🥳.
